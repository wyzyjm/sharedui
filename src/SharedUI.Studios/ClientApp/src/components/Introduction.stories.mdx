<div>

Build faster, more consistent experiences, with fewer distinct bugs for the studio UX investments by delivering shared components that can be reused across the studios (e.g. authentication, sign-in, navigation, breadcrumbs, grid view, lists, etc.).â€‹

Eg: Reduce duplicate accessibility bugs across studios that have distinct resolutions (e.g. studio X uses button for some breadcrumbs, studio B uses link for breadcrumbs). Both get accessibility bugs and must be resolved independently to achieve our grade C goal.
